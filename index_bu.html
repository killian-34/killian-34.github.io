								<h3>Researcher</h3>
								<p>I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Harvard University, studying how machine learning and optimization can solve challenges in public health. Advised by <a target="new" href="https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu/people/milind-tambe" class="pretty-link">Prof. Milind Tambe</a>, my work currently focuses on developing <a target="new" class="pretty-link" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3292500.3330777">predictive models</a> and <a target="new" class="pretty-link" href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/hash/b460cf6b09878b00a3e1ad4c72344ccd-Abstract.html">sequential planning tools</a> for community health workers in India combatting tuberculosis -- part of this work I conducted from Banglore while on a research internship with MSR India, advised by Dr. Amit Sharma. Previously, I have worked on models for simulating <a target="new" class="pretty-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2010651117">non-pharmacological interventions for preventing the spread of COVID-19</a> and designed machine learning models for detecting sobriety using mobile health data <a target="new" class="pretty-link" href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bar+Crawl%3A+Detecting+Heavy+Drinking">(check out the dataset!)</a> During my undergraduate at The Ohio State Univeristy, I studied computational genetics as a <a target="new" class="pretty-link" href="pdf/2017 Pelotonia Investment Report.PDF">Pelotonia fellow</a>.</p>

								<h3>Organizer</h3>
								<p>I co-direct the <a href="https://www.haihg.org/" class="pretty-link" >Harvard AI in Healthcare Group</a>, a cross-sectional organization that brings together students, researchers and entrepreneurs from across disciplines to explore opportunities and hear from leading experts in this exciting space. I also co-organize the <a href="https://crcs.seas.harvard.edu/event/workshop_ai_society" class="pretty-link">Harvard CRCS Rising Stars Workshop</a> which seeks to highlight and provide networking and mentorship opportunities to budding junior researchers dedicated to studying AI for Social Impact.

								<h3>Data Analyst</h3>
								<p>In 2018, I interned with <a href="https://www.spatial.ai/" target=new class="pretty-link">Spatial.AI</a>, a tech startup leading the way for geosocial data. There, I designed NLP pipelines with Python to compute "lifestyle stats" for cities using geotagged social media. I also built predictive models based on these stats combined with demographic data to estimate success of retail store fronts.

								<h3>Database Designer</h3>
								<p>I was hired in 2014 by a small private bussing company that decided it was time to stop managing all of their data with Excel. I designed for them a Microsoft Access Database to handle hundreds of assets and equipped it with a custom schedule system for drivers. Little did I know that this would spark my love of computer science! I still provide technical support and regular updates for my best customers.

								<h3>Drummer</h3>
								<p>Everyone needs a way to relax. I do it by beating a (my own) drum. And sometimes I even get the chance to do it on stage! Music is a life-long passion of mine that I am always looking to exercise.</p>

							<h3>Research Interests</h3>
								<p>My research currently lies at the intersection of machine learning, optimization and public health. This has led me to technical interests in sequential planning paradigms including Markov Decision Processes and Restless Bandits. My application-based interests derive from the challenges of making AI tools work for community health workers in the field, especially in low-resource contexts. I am also broadly interested in data science problems that leverage human-generated behavioral data to derive insights focused on improving health.

								<!-- Old statement :) <p>Through social networks, mobile devices, and the growing internet-of-things, humans produce a massive amount of data daily. I want to apply large-scale data analysis and machine learning to leverage and make insights on that human-generated data to effect social good. -->
