							<h3>Researcher</h3>
							<p>I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Harvard University, studying how machine learning and optimization can solve problems for social good. My work currently focuses on infectious disease, modeling non-pharmacological interventions for <a class="pretty-link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3564800">preventing the spread of COVID-19</a> and building <a class="pretty-link" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3292500.3330777">predictive models of medication adherence</a> for TB patients in India. I have also designed machine learning models for detecting sobriety using mobile health data <a class="pretty-link" href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bar+Crawl%3A+Detecting+Heavy+Drinking">(check out the dataset!)</a>. Before computer science, I studied computational genetics as a <a target="new" class="pretty-link" href="pdf/2017 Pelotonia Investment Report.PDF">Pelotonia fellow</a>.</p>

							<h3>Data Analyst</h3>
							<p>In the Summer of 2018, I interned with Spatial.AI, a tech startup breaking into the space of geosocial data. There, I designed NLP pipelines with Python to compute “social scores” for cities using geotagged social media. I also built predictive models based on these social scores and demographic data to estimate success of retail store fronts.

							<h3>Database Designer</h3>
							<p>I was hired in 2014 by a bussing company that decided it was time to stop managing all of their data with Excel. I built them a Microsoft Access Database to handle hundreds of assets and equipped it with a custom schedule system for drivers. Little did I know that this would spark my love of computer science! I still provide technical support and regular updates for my best customers, and probably will until Microsoft goes out of business.

							<h3>Drummer</h3>
							<p>Everyone needs a way to relax. I do it by beating a (my own) drum. And sometimes I even get the chance to do it on stage! Music is a life-long passion of mine that I am always looking to exercise.

						<h3>Research Interests</h3>
						<p>Through social networks, mobile devices, and the growing internet-of-things, humans produce a massive amount of data daily. I want to apply large-scale data analysis and machine learning to leverage and make insights on that human-generated data to effect social good.
