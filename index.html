							<h3>Researcher</h3>
							<p>I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, studying how machine learning and optimization can solve problems for social good. I did similar work during my undergraduate career where I carried out a <a class="pretty-link" href="projects.html">thesis</a> that applied machine learning to mobile health data. Before computer science, I studied cancer-related computational genetics serving as both a <a target="new" class="pretty-link" href="https://cancer.osu.edu/research-and-education/pelotonia-funded-research/pelotonia-fellowship-program/undergraduate-student-pelotonia-fellowship-program">Pelotonia fellow</a> and a <a class="pretty-link" href="projects.html">first author.</a></p>

							<h3>Data Analyst</h3>
							<p>In the Summer of 2018, I interned with Spatial.AI, a tech startup breaking into the space of geosocial data. There, I designed NLP pipelines with Python to compute “social scores” for cities using geotagged social medai. I also built predictive models based on those these social scores and demographic data to estimate success of retail store fronts.

							<h3>Database Designer</h3>
							<p>I was hired in 2014 by a bussing company that decided it was time to stop managing all of their data with Excel. I built them a Microsoft Access Database to handle hundreds of assets and equipped it with a custom schedule system for drivers. I still provide technical support and regular updates for my best customers, and probably will until Microsoft goes out of business.

							<h3>Drummer</h3>
							<p>Everyone needs a way to relax. I do it by beating a (my own) drum. And sometimes I even get the chance to do it on stage! Music is a life-long passion of mine that I am always looking to exercise.

						<h3>Research Interests</h3>
						<p>Through social networks, mobile devices, and the growing internet-of-things, humans produce a massive amount of data daily. I want to apply large-scale data analysis and machine learning to leverage and make insights on that human-generated data to effect social good.
